  # 1. Real .ROBLOSECURITY cookie literal.
  #
  # The prefix ALONE is not the discriminator, and matching on it alone is what turned this check
  # red on main. A real cookie is the warning prefix, then the `.|_` separator, then hundreds of
  # characters of session blob. The two things this used to flag are the capture tool's own secret
  # scanner — which necessarily contains this pattern because it scans for it — and that scanner's
  # self-test fixture, which stops at the human-readable tail and carries no session data at all.
  # Neither is a credential, and a scanner that cannot tell a scanner from a secret blocks every
  # commit to the file whose job is finding secrets.
  #
  # So require the blob. This is deliberately NOT an allowlist: no file is trusted, so a real cookie
  # pasted into capture-ui.ps1 still fails here, which matters because that script is the one that
  # handles cookies. Precision goes up and nothing gets a pass.
  #
  # {20,} is safe margin, not a tight fit — real cookies run to several hundred characters, so an
  # editor tightening this later has room before it risks clipping one. Same reasoning
  # capture-ui.ps1:512-514 already applies to its webhook floor.
  #
  # NOTE the capture tool's own pattern (capture-ui.ps1:516) stays loose on purpose and the two are
  # meant to differ: this one guards COMMITS and wants precision so fixtures do not block the repo;
  # that one guards SCREENSHOTS and wants recall, because a partial cookie rendered on screen is
  # still worth refusing to capture.
  #
  # -I skips binary files (cookie strings are text; binary key blobs caught separately below).
